(Verse 1)
In the heart of Charlotte, they thrive,
Snap One's the name, and they're alive.
Smart solutions, they design and weave,
Making life better, you best believe.

(Pre-Chorus)
From audio to video, surveillance too,
Their tech prowess knows no bounds, it's true.
Networking, conferencing, control galore,
Snap One's got it all, and then some more.

(Chorus)
Snap One, Snap Two, let the bass groove,
Their products rock, make your world move.
From homes to businesses, they pave the way,
Trusted professionals, night and day.

(Verse 2)
They’re the beat behind the scenes, Bringing joy, connection, and security dreams. Structured wiring, racks, and mounts they deploy, Snap One’s the rhythm, the ultimate joy.

(Pre-Chorus) OvrC in the cloud, remote magic they wield, End consumers empowered.

(Chorus)
Snap One, Snap Two, let the bass groove,
Their products rock, make your world move.
From homes to businesses, they pave the way,
Trusted professionals, night and day.

(Outro)
So here’s to Snap One, the rhythm and beat, Innovators, creators, can’t be beat. 
Turn up the bass.
